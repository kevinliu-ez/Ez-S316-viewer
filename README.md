# Ez S316 Viewer (for Engineering Purpose)

Ez S316 Viewer is a lightweight MS Windows application that provides basic functionality to real-time display the depth map and RGB point cloud from the EzRGBD device.

## Setup
* Hardware
  * Plug the USB DC power supply into a power outlet.
  * Connect a USB 3.0 cable from the EzRGBD device to your MS Windows computer.
  * Connect a USB 2.0 cable from the USB DC power supply to the EzRGBD device.
> The current configuration of the device is optimized for static scenes, a tripod is recommended for holding the device.
* Software
  * Install the MS Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015. Or you can find the installer [here](https://github.com/kevinliu-ez/Ez-S316-viewer/blob/master/Setup/MSVCRedist_x64_VS2015-2017-2019.exe) in the repository.
